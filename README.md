# PyTorch Model

This repository contains a simple PyTorch implementation of a linear regression model and the associated workflow.

## Introduction

This PyTorch model is designed to demonstrate the basics of building and training a linear regression model using PyTorch. The model predicts a linear relationship between input and output values and is used as an educational example.

## Workflow

1. **Create Known Parameters**: Define known parameters, such as weights and biases.
2. **Create Data**: Generate synthetic data for training and testing the model.
3. **Build Model**: Define a linear regression model using PyTorch.
4. **Train Model**: Train the model using gradient descent and backpropagation.
5. **Evaluate Model**: Evaluate the trained model's performance.
6. **Visualization**: Visualize the data, model, and predictions.

## Usage

To use this repository:

1. Follow the provided Google Colab Notebook (`1st Model.py`) to understand the workflow and experiment with the linear regression model.
